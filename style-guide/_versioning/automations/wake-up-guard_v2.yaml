    # Wake-up guard

    Time-based wake-up with bed/workshop presence conditions, TTS announcements
    (static or LLM-generated), one snooze, mobile push with Snooze/Stop buttons,
    optional Assist Satellite TTS interrupt, and a music handoff script.

    ### Flow

    1. Fires at wake-up time on selected weekdays.
    2. Checks bed presence duration and workshop emptiness duration.
    3. Optionally turns on switches/lights.
    4. Prepares wake-up message (static or LLM).
    5. Optional mobile notification with Snooze/Stop.
    6. TTS announcement → wait for Snooze/Stop/timeout.
    7. If Snooze: pause, then repeat TTS + wait once more (second snooze = Stop).
    8. If Stop or final timeout: run music script, restore volume, clean up.

    ### Recent changes

    - **v2:** Fixed bed/workshop duration checks (were broken — only checked current
      state, not duration). Added collapsible input sections. Migrated service → action.
      Added numbered comments. Fixed toggle cleanup on default path.
    - **v1:** Initial version.
