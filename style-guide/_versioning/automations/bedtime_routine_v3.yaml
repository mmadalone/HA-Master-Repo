    # Bedtime routine – LLM-driven goodnight

    Fully LLM-orchestrated bedtime wind-down. Stops the TV, kills lights (except
    living room lamp), then drives a multi-turn conversation: announces bedtime with
    configurable countdown, optionally negotiates extra time, offers audiobook selection,
    says goodnight, and finally turns off the lamp — with bathroom occupancy guard to
    prevent lights-out while someone is in the bathroom.

    ### Recent changes

    - **v3:** Style guide compliance — syntax, cleanup, dividers, aliases

    - **v2:** IR state guard (skip IR if TV already off via CEC); media player
    multi-stop before lights-off

    - **v1:** Initial version'
