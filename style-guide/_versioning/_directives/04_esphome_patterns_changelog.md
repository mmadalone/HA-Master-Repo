# 04_esphome_patterns — Changelog

## v1 — 2026-02-08
- Baseline after audit edits:
  - Added OTA platform version note: `platform: esphome` required for ESPHome 2024.6+
- ⚠️ VERSIONING GAP: pre-audit state was not captured. These edits were applied before the §2.1 scope was tightened to cover documentation files.
