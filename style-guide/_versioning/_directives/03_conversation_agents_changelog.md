# 03_conversation_agents — Changelog

## v1 — 2026-02-08
- Baseline after audit edits (MAJOR EXPANSION — 60→180 lines):
  - Added token budget awareness note to §8.2
  - Added §8.3.1: complete example prompt skeleton (Rick persona, 4-section structure)
  - Added §8.3.2: tool/function exposure patterns — thin wrapper scripts, description best practices, what NOT to expose
  - Added §8.5: multi-agent coordination — handoff pattern, current limitations, rules for independent agents
- ⚠️ VERSIONING GAP: pre-audit state was not captured. These edits were applied before the §2.1 scope was tightened to cover documentation files.
