# 00_core_philosophy — Changelog

## v2 — 2026-02-11
- STRUCTURAL FIX: Moved §1.12 (Directive precedence) from orphaned position between §9 and §12 back into §1, after §1.11. AI agents told to "load §1 only" now get the complete section including conflict resolution rules.
- Updated all token counts in §1.9 per-file table to match actual measured values (Feb 2026).
- Updated §1.9 "§1 alone" token estimate from ~3.5K to ~5.3K (reflects §1.12 inclusion + accurate measurement).
- Updated total style guide token estimate from ~58K to ~74K in §1.9.
- Updated §1.9 T0 tier token estimate to match corrected §1 size.

## v1 — 2026-02-11
- Baseline before structural audit fixes.
