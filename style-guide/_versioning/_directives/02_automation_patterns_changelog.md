# 02_automation_patterns — Changelog

## v1 — 2026-02-08
- Baseline after audit edits:
  - Added §5.5 justification note: GPS bounce template is legitimate exception to native-first rule (no native equivalent for "time since last triggered")
- ⚠️ VERSIONING GAP: pre-audit state was not captured. These edits were applied before the §2.1 scope was tightened to cover documentation files.
