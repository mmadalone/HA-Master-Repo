    ## Music Assistant – Manage Follow Me toggle

    This automation manages your `music_follow_me` (or similar) toggle:
      - Option 1: **Auto-disable** when all players are idle for X minutes.
      - Option 2 (optional): **Auto-enable** when any monitored player starts playing.

    ### What this does

    - Triggers on *any* state change of the selected Music Assistant players.
    - On each trigger it calculates:
      - `all_idle` → all monitored players are non-playing for at least `Idle minutes`.
      - `any_playing` → at least one monitored player is `playing`.

    Then it does:

    1. **Turn OFF** the follow switch when:
       - Follow switch is **ON**, and
       - `all_idle` is **true**.

    2. **Turn ON** the follow switch when:
       - `Auto-enable on playback` is **true**, and
       - Follow switch is **OFF**, and
       - `any_playing` is **true**.

    These two branches are mutually exclusive:
      - It only turns OFF when the switch is currently ON.
      - It only turns ON when the switch is currently OFF.

    ### Typical setup

    - Use this together with your "Music Assistant – Follow Me (multi-room)"
      blueprint which actually moves the queue based on presence sensors.
    - This one just manages the **input_boolean** that gates that behaviour.

    ### Inputs

    - **Follow music toggle**:
      The input_boolean (e.g. `input_boolean.music_follow_me`).

    - **Music players to monitor**:
      All Music Assistant players that may hold your queue.

    - **Idle minutes**:
      How long ALL those players must be idle before auto-disabling.

    - **Auto-enable on playback**:
      If true, starting MA playback on any monitored player will
      automatically turn the follow switch ON.
