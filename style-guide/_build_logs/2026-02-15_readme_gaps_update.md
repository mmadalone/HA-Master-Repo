# Build Log: README.md Gap Fixes
**Date:** 2026-02-15
**Status:** completed
**File:** GIT_REPO/README.md
**Mode:** BUILD (compact)

## Task
Add four missing sections to the repo README:
1. Claude Project Configuration (instructions field, paths, filesystem architecture)
2. `ha_style_guide_project_instructions.md` in Style Guide table
3. Rules of Acquisition personality in Style Guide description
4. Development Toolchain (Desktop Commander, MCP tools, git MCP, ripgrep, Context7, Gemini)

## Decisions
- Expand "How It's Built" to include toolchain rather than a separate section
- Add "Claude Project Configuration" as a new section after Style Guide
- Inject Ferengi personality into Style Guide section header/description
