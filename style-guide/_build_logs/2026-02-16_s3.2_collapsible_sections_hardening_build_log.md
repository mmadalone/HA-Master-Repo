# Build Log — §3.2 Collapsible Sections Hardening

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**File:** `01_blueprint_patterns.md`
**Section:** §3.2 — Collapsible input sections
**Mode:** BUILD (single-file, surgical edit)
**Status:** completed

## Scope

Four changes to §3.2:

1. **Kill the "optional" exception** — Replace "If a blueprint only has 3-4 inputs total, sections are optional but still preferred" with a hard no-exceptions rule. All blueprints use collapsible sections regardless of input count.
2. **Add `collapsed:` default-state rule** — Sections ① and ② expanded (default behavior, no key needed). Section ③ and all subsequent sections MUST include `collapsed: true`.
3. **Update YAML example** — Add `collapsed: true` to the ③ and ④ sections in the existing code block.
4. **Cross-reference `min_version`** — Note that `collapsed: true` inherits the `min_version: 2024.6.0` requirement already documented in §3.1.

## Decisions

- The collapsed/expanded boundary at section ③ reflects the pattern: primary config (triggers, core entities) is visible on first open; advanced/optional settings are tucked away.
- No new anti-pattern code needed — this is a strengthening of existing §3.2 MANDATORY rules, not a new AP.
- Master index ToC does not need updating — §3.2 title unchanged.

## Files touched

- `01_blueprint_patterns.md` — §3.2 edits only
- `ha_style_guide_project_instructions.md` — version bump + changelog entry
