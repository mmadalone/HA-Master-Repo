# Build Log — smart-bathroom.yaml audit fixes

## Meta
- **Date:** 2026-02-19
- **Blueprint:** smart-bathroom.yaml
- **Mode:** BUILD (escalated from AUDIT)
- **Audit report:** 2026-02-19_smart-bathroom_audit_report.log
- **Git checkpoint:** checkpoint_20260219_214344 (59ecad76)
- **Status:** completed

## Task
Apply two minor fixes from audit findings:
1. AP-08: Add YAML comment noting audit exemption (accepted complexity)
2. Advisory 1: Add `continue_on_error: true` to Branch 6 light-off for pattern consistency

## Decisions
- AP-08 exemption via comment, not code change — complexity is intrinsic
- Branch 6 gets continue_on_error to match all other light actions

## Files modified
- `blueprints/automation/madalone/smart-bathroom.yaml`

## Edit Log
1. Added AP-08 exemption comment block above `actions: - choose:` (4 comment lines)
2. Added `continue_on_error: true` to Branch 6 light-off action (pattern consistency)
3. Bumped changelog to v6 in blueprint description

## Current state
Starting edits.
