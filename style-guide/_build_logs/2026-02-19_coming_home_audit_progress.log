[CHECK] AP-08 | PASS | Action block ~200 lines, max nesting depth 4 (within threshold)
[CHECK] AP-09 | PASS | 4 collapsible input sections (①②③④)
[CHECK] AP-09a | PASS | All 12 inputs have explicit defaults

[CHECK] AP-16 | PASS | state_attr() has | default('someone'), this.attributes.last_triggered has | default()
[CHECK] AP-17 | PASS | continue_on_error used only on non-critical or defended paths (reset switches, LLM fallback, satellite, logbook)

[CHECK] AP-21 | PASS | No raw secrets
[CHECK] AP-22 | PASS | min_version: 2025.4.0 set (required for assist_satellite.start_conversation)

[CHECK] S1-secrets | PASS | No raw API keys, passwords, or tokens
[CHECK] S2-input-validation | PASS | All templated inputs have | default() guards, selectors constrain types
[CHECK] S3-template-injection | PASS | No unsanitized user input in action calls
[CHECK] S4-target-constraints | PASS | All service calls have explicit entity targets from inputs
