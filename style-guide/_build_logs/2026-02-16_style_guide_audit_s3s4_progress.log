[RECOVERY] continues from 2026-02-16_style_guide_deep_audit_s1s2 — stages 1-2 complete
[STAGE] 3 — AI-Readability & Architecture | STATUS: COMPLETE | findings: 2
  [CHECK] AIR-1 | PASS | 0 findings (vague guidance hits are all in checklist definitions or negative examples)
  [CHECK] AIR-2 | PASS | 0 findings (all named patterns have YAML skeletons)
  [CHECK] AIR-3 | PASS | 0 findings (decision points have explicit selection criteria)
  [CHECK] AIR-4 | PASS | 0 findings (bad examples preceded by correct skeletons)
  [CHECK] AIR-5 | PASS | 0 findings (§1.8 complexity budget has concrete table with hard ceilings)
  [CHECK] AIR-6 | FAIL | 1 finding (master index token claim ~4.6K, measured ~8.9K — 93% drift)
  [CHECK] AIR-7 | PASS | 0 findings (cross-file topics consistent: continue_on_error, volume duck/restore, TTS)
  [CHECK] ARCH-1 | PASS | 0 findings (recovered from s1s2 session)
  [CHECK] ARCH-2 | PASS | 0 findings (recovered from s1s2 session)
  [CHECK] ARCH-3 | PASS | 0 findings (recovered from s1s2 session)
  [CHECK] ARCH-4 | PASS | 0 findings (recovered from s1s2 session)
  [CHECK] ARCH-5 | PASS | 0 findings (recovered from s1s2 session — 0 orphans, 5 explainable ghosts)
  [CHECK] ARCH-6 | FAIL | 1 finding (recovered from s1s2 session — 19 blueprints missing READMEs, 3 orphan READMEs)
[STAGE] 4 — Integration, Zones & Maintenance | STATUS: COMPLETE | findings: 7
  [CHECK] INT-1 | PASS | 0 findings (all 6 sub-items documented; 1 INFO — MCP missing 2025.9+ improvement note)
  [CHECK] INT-2 | PASS | 0 findings (all 5 sub-items documented and complete)
  [CHECK] INT-3 | PASS | 0 findings (all 7 sub-items documented and thorough)
  [CHECK] INT-4 | PASS | 0 findings (all 7 sub-items documented and complete)
  [CHECK] ZONE-1 | PASS | 0 findings (zone radius guidance, cooldown pattern, concrete 200-300m recommendation all present in §5.5)
  [CHECK] ZONE-2 | PASS | 0 findings (version req HA 2025.12+, Labs/experimental status, trigger types documented in §5.11)
  [CHECK] MAINT-1 | PASS | 0 findings (8/9 VER-1 claims verified; MCP 2025.9+ improvement unconfirmed — consistent with INT-1 INFO)
  [CHECK] MAINT-2 | PASS | 0 findings (no guide-relevant deprecations in HA 2025.12–2026.2; legacy template entity deprecation is config.yaml scope, not blueprint/automation)
  [CHECK] MAINT-3 | FAIL | 4 findings (MA 2.7 features, ESPHome 2025.12/2026.1 features, HA 2025.12-2026.2 features undocumented)
  [CHECK] MAINT-4 | PASS | 0 findings (1 INFO — ESPHome .html links may eventually break)
  [CHECK] MAINT-5 | PASS | 0 findings (1 INFO — MA voice-support blueprint repo patterns evolving)
  [CHECK] BP-1 | PASS | 0 findings (guide's §3.1 metadata table complete; BP-1 check definition in QA accurate; all required fields documented with correct nesting)
  [CHECK] BP-2 | PASS | 0 findings (1 INFO carried from MAINT-3 — missing `choose` selector in QA table; guide's §3.2 selector guidance covers all common cases correctly)
  [CHECK] BP-3 | PASS | 0 findings (guide's CQ-7/CQ-9 template safety patterns and §3.6 default guards address the edge cases BP-3 tests for; no gaps in edge-case documentation)
