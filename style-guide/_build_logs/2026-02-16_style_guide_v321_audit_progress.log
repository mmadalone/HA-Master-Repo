[SESSION] 2026-02-16 | type: deep-pass audit | scope: style guide v3.21 — all 10 content files + master index
[STAGE] 1 — Security & Versions | STATUS: COMPLETE
[CHECK] SEC-1 | PASS | 0 findings (all hits in legitimate secrets.yaml examples or check definitions)
[CHECK] SEC-2 | PASS | 0 findings (§1.12 safety carve-out present and explicit)
[CHECK] SEC-3 | PASS | 0 findings (text selectors flow to purpose-built service endpoints only)
[CHECK] VER-1 | PASS | 0 findings (11 claims web-verified: template deprecation, purpose triggers, ESPHome OTA MD5, dual wake words, TTS streaming, sub-devices, ask_question, MCP servers + 3 more)
[CHECK] VER-2 | SKIPPED (deferred — requires YAML block parsing in markdown)
[CHECK] VER-3 | PARTIAL PASS | 0 findings in verified entries (template deprecation timeline verified, data_template caveat documented)
[STAGE] 2 — Code Quality & Performance | STATUS: COMPLETE
[CHECK] CQ-1 | PASS (INFO) | ~14 examples omit aliases, all brief illustrative snippets — §3.5 explicitly permits this
[CHECK] CQ-2 | PASS | 0 findings (error handling well documented in §5.2, AP-17 flags blanket continue_on_error)
[CHECK] CQ-3 | PASS | 0 findings (cleanup patterns in §7.4 duck/restore, §5.12 restart caveat)
[CHECK] CQ-4 | PASS | 0 findings (response paths documented in §8.3 + comparison table in §14)
[CHECK] CQ-5 | PASS | 0 findings (all action domains valid HA domains; full parse validation deferred)
[CHECK] CQ-6 | PASS | 0 findings (zero legacy service: in YAML blocks outside deliberate anti-examples)
[CHECK] CQ-7 | PASS | 0 findings (all states() hits are guarded, anti-examples, or debug playground)
[CHECK] CQ-8 | PASS | 0 findings (toggle/increment only in QA check definitions)
[CHECK] CQ-9 | PASS | 0 findings (availability taught via §3.6 + CQ-9 definition)
[CHECK] CQ-10 | PASS | 0 findings (logbook.log in examples, CQ-10 definition comprehensive)
[CHECK] PERF-1 | PASS | 0 findings (all state triggers specify entity_id, no aggressive time patterns)
[STAGE] 3 — AI-Readability & Architecture | STATUS: IN_PROGRESS
[STAGE] 4 — Integration, Zones & Maintenance | STATUS: PENDING
