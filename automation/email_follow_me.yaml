    # Email Follow-Me

    When a new email arrives via the IMAP integration, this blueprint
    determines which room you're in via FP2 presence sensors, routes to
    the nearest voice satellite, and has a conversation agent summarize
    who emailed and what it's about — completely hands-free.

    Uses the HA IMAP integration's `imap_content` event as the data
    source. Includes blocked-sender filtering, keyword-based whitelist
    or blacklist, configurable cooldown, quiet hours, DND respect,
    and attachment detection with "check your inbox" fallback.

    ### Recent changes
    - **v1.4.0:** Verbosity control + UID dedup + LLM multi-email
      context + agent self-awareness v2 + reminder escalation.
      New `announcement_style` selector (full_summary/brief/headline)
      controls announcement depth. UID dedup gate prevents
      re-announcement of duplicate IMAP events using a lightweight
      `input_text` helper with fingerprint fallback. LLM prompts
      now receive last announced sender/subject and IMAP unread
      count for natural multi-email awareness. Agent self-awareness
      rewritten with fuzzy name matching, addressee detection,
      first-person response mode for agent-targeted emails, and
      personality preservation. New `reminder_style` selector with
      escalation (headline → brief → full LLM) or match mode.
      First-person stance persists across all reminder iterations.
    - **v1.3.0:** Agent self-awareness + playback poll race fix +
      LLM-powered reminders. New optional `agent_display_name` input
      in §① lets the LLM know its own name — injected into both the
      initial summarization prompt and reminder prompts so the agent
      recognizes references to itself in email content (e.g., "Rick
      is dumb") without hardcoding any persona name. Default empty —
      falls back to generic assistant phrasing. Playback poll (step
      8-wait and R9) upgraded to two-phase: Phase 1 waits for the
      satellite to enter `playing` state (5s cap), Phase 2 waits for
      it to leave `playing` (60s cap). Fixes premature volume restore
      when the TTS stream hasn't started buffering yet. Reminders
      upgraded from static template to full LLM call — the agent
      re-summarizes with escalation context (reminder number and
      elapsed time), maintaining personality and self-awareness across
      all reminder iterations. Static fallback preserved for LLM
      failures. Replaces `reminder_message_template` input with
      `reminder_prompt`.
    - **v1.2.0:** Added ducking flag integration — sets a shared
      input_boolean ON during duck cycles (main + reminder) so
      external volume-sync automations back off. Prevents race
      conditions with Alexa ↔ MA volume sync.

            YOUR IDENTITY: Your name is {{ agent_name }}. This may
            appear in emails as creative spellings, elongations,
            caps variations, or nicknames — treat any plausible
            variant as referring to you. Check both subject and body.

            ADDRESSEE DETECTION: Determine whether the email is
            directed at you or at the user. Signals include your
            name in the subject line, second-person language aimed
            at you ("Hey {{ agent_name }}", "you're useless
            {{ agent_name }}"), or questions about your state or
            behavior. Insults and compliments using your name are
            almost always directed at you, not the user.

            RESPONSE MODE: If the email is directed at you, react
            in first person — you are the recipient. Do NOT
            summarize it in detached third person. If the email
            merely mentions you but is addressed to the user,
            summarize normally but acknowledge the mention.

            PERSONALITY: Stay in character. If someone insults you,
            respond as your persona would — do not break character
            to deliver a neutral summary.
            {% endif %}

            The sender's preferred name is {{ display_sender }}. Always
            refer to them by this name exactly — do not use any other

                      questions about your state or behavior.

                      RESPONSE MODE: If the email is directed at you,
                      react in first person — you are the recipient.
                      Do NOT summarize it in detached third person.

                      PERSONALITY: Stay in character. If someone
                      insults you, respond as your persona would.

                      FIRST-PERSON PERSISTENCE: If you responded to
                      this email in first person on the initial
                      announcement, maintain that same stance — do
