    # Notification Follow-Me

    When a messaging notification arrives on your phone (WhatsApp, Signal, SMS,
    or any selected app), this blueprint determines which room you're in via
    FP2 presence sensors, routes to the nearest voice satellite, and has a
    conversation agent summarize the message — completely hands-free.

    Uses the Android Companion App's `last_notification` sensor as the data
    source. Includes blocked-sender filtering, configurable cooldown,
    quiet hours, DND respect, and media message detection with "check your
    phone" fallback.

    ### Recent changes
    - **v3.17.0:** Agent randomizer support — new ⑨ section with optional
      script call that overrides conversation agent + TTS entity at runtime;
      forces TTS mode to standard when active; "called by name trumps random"
      detection at step 6d swaps to the addressed agent's full pair from the
      roster when a non-active agent is named in the notification text;
      alias-aware matching supports nicknames and misspellings via
      comma-separated aliases per agent
    - **v3.16.0:** App-aware R3c gate — evicts only the app the user is viewing, not all reminders
    - **v3.16.0:** New last_used_app_sensor + notification_app_packages inputs for foreground detection
    - **v3.16.0:** Four-branch R3c: unconfigured backwards-compat, per-app eviction, unrelated-app pass

            Lines in the message thread prefixed with "You:" are
            messages sent BY the notification recipient (the person
            you are speaking to) — not from the sender or any third
            party. Do not treat the text after "You:" as a person's
            name. These are the user's own outbound replies.
            --- END THREAD FORMAT CONTEXT ---

            --- OUTGOING MESSAGE GUARD ---
            If the message text looks like an outgoing action rather
            than an incoming message — for example "Sending GIF to…",
            "Sending photo to…", "Sharing media to…", or any
            progress/status text about content YOU are sending —
            respond with exactly SKIP_OUTGOING and nothing else.

            --- PRONOUN CONTEXT ---
            When "you" or "tú" appears in the message text, it usually

            these names (e.g., amor → amorcito, guapo → guapetón) also

            --- EXPRESSIVE TEXT INTERPRETATION ---
            The message may contain informal, expressive text that
            is NOT meant to be read literally. Interpret these
            patterns naturally for spoken delivery:
            {% if _expr_sens == 'conservative' %}
            Only interpret obvious laughter patterns (hahaha, jajaja,
            LOL) and explicit emoji-only messages. Leave other
            informal text as-is.
            {% elif _expr_sens == 'aggressive' %}
            Aggressively interpret ALL informal text as expressive
            intent — elongated words, emoji clusters, repeated
            punctuation, slang abbreviations, and any text that
            looks more emotional than informational. Convert
            everything into natural spoken language.
            {% else %}
            Interpret laughter, elongated words (nooooo, siiii),
            emoji clusters, and other clearly expressive text as
            emotional intent. Describe what the sender is expressing
            rather than spelling out the characters.
            {% endif %}

            Key rules:
            - Laughter patterns → describe as laughter, never
              spell out syllables (no "ja ja ja")
            - Emoji-only messages → describe the emotional
              sentiment, never name individual emoji
            - Elongated words → interpret the emphasis, don't
              reproduce the stretching
            - Repeated punctuation (!!!, ???) → convey the
              energy through your delivery, not by reading
              the punctuation
            {% set _expr_ref = expressive_ref | default('') | string | trim %}
            {% if _expr_ref | length > 0 %}

            Cultural reference patterns (format: pattern=meaning):

            Use these as hints — generalize to similar patterns
            the sender might use.

            --- TTS PERFORMANCE DIRECTIVES (ElevenLabs v3) ---
            Your output will be spoken by an ElevenLabs v3 voice.
            You may insert audio tags in square brackets to direct
            the voice performance. Available tags include:
            [laughs], [whispers], [shouts], [sighs], [pauses],
            [sarcastic], [excited], [gasps], [cheerfully],
            [deadpan], [playfully], [hesitates].
            {% if _tag_style == 'minimal' %}
            Use tags sparingly — only for strong emotional moments.
            Most announcements should have zero tags. Reserve them
            for content that genuinely demands dramatization.
            {% elif _tag_style == 'dramatic' %}
            Use tags liberally for theatrical delivery. Add
            performance cues wherever they enhance the emotional
            texture — reactions, pauses, tone shifts, laughter.
            Make it a performance.
            {% else %}
            Use tags in moderation — typically 1-2 per announcement
            for natural emphasis. React to emotional content with
            appropriate tags but don't overdo it.
            {% endif %}

            Important: Tags go INLINE with your text, not on
            separate lines. Example: "[laughs] She thinks that's
            hilarious." Never put tags where they'd interrupt a
            word or break a sentence unnaturally. Never end your
            response with an audio tag — always follow tags with
            spoken text so the voice has something to transition into.
