    # Notification Follow-Me

    When a messaging notification arrives on your phone (WhatsApp, Signal, SMS,
    or any selected app), this blueprint determines which room you're in via
    FP2 presence sensors, routes to the nearest voice satellite, and has a
    conversation agent summarize the message — completely hands-free.

    Uses the Android Companion App's `last_notification` sensor as the data
    source. Includes blocked-sender filtering, configurable cooldown,
    quiet hours, DND respect, and media message detection with "check your
    phone" fallback.

    ### Recent changes
    - **v3.12.5:** Pronoun grounding (Issue 3) — adds PRONOUN CONTEXT
      fence to all 4 LLM prompt sites. Instructs the agent that "you/tú"
      in notification text refers to the phone's owner unless the sender
      addresses the agent by name.
    - **v3.12.4:** GIF media detection fix (Issue 8) — removed "GIF"
      from substring-based `media_patterns` to prevent false positives
      on normal messages mentioning GIF. Animated sticker notifications
      (`<emoji> GIF`, ≤10 chars) are now detected via a dedicated
      short-text + suffix check in `is_media_message`.
    - **v3.12.3:** Supersede-safe restore (Option 3) — when a
      reminder while-loop (R0, LT0, FR0) exits due to supersede
      (newer notification cycle owns the cooldown helper), the
      exiting cycle now performs a defensive duck cleanup:
      checks snapshot helpers for stale state, conditionally
      decrements the refcount, and if last duck, restores
      volumes from snapshots, clears helpers, and clears the
      ducking flag. Terminates immediately via `stop:` instead
      of cascading through subsequent phases. Double-decrement
      guarded by snapshot-non-empty check. Belt half of
      belt-and-suspenders with duck_refcount_watchdog.
    - **v3.12.2:** Satellite snapshot float-cast fix — the
      `_sat_stored_vol` variable could resolve to a float when the
      snapshot helper contained a numeric string (e.g. "0.46"),
      causing `TypeError: object of type 'float' has no len()` on
      the `saved_volume` and `_sat_snap_is_fresh` length checks.
      Added `| string` before `| length` on both uses. Latent bug
      exposed by stranded duck state (Issue 7) leaving stale data
      in the snapshot helper.
    - **v3.12.1:** Outgoing message gate (Issue 5 partial) —
      New `self_names` input accepts a comma-separated list of
      the user's own display names. Step 1b drops two categories
      of self-generated noise: notifications with
      `category: transport` (Signal voice notes, media controls)
      and notifications where the sender name matches any entry
      in the self-names list (case-insensitive). Outgoing text
      prefix detection (Check 3) deferred — blocked on WhatsApp
      format capture.
    - **v3.12.0:** Trigger-timestamp cooldown + zombie supersede —
      Step 9a now writes `trigger.to_state.last_changed` instead of
      `now()` to the cooldown helper, so cooldown gates compare
      trigger timestamps rather than wall-clock time (Issue 4).
      All three reminder loops (standard R0, long-tail LT0,
      full-restart FR0) now include a supersede check: each
      iteration reads the helper timestamp and self-terminates
      if a newer cycle has written a more recent value, preventing
      zombie loops from squatting in parallel slots and starving
      new notifications (Issue 6).
    - **v3.11.0:** Duck refcount (parallel burst guard) — new optional
      `duck_refcount_helper` input_number in §⑦. Tracks how many
      active duck cycles are in flight across parallel runs. Only
      the last run to finish TTS delivery restores volumes —
      preventing burst messages from prematurely undoing the duck
      while other announcements are still playing. Applied to
      all four duck/restore paths: main announcement (7f→8),
      standard reminders (R5b→R9), long-tail single_check
      (LT6b→LT8), and full_restart (FR-duck→FR-restore).
      Helper-aware restore resolution reads from shared snapshot
      helpers when available, falling back to per-run snapshots.
      Requires the duck snapshot helper to be configured.
    - **v3.10.2:** Ducking flag integration — new optional
      `ducking_flag` input_boolean in §⑦. Set ON during duck
      cycles and OFF after restore, signaling external volume-sync
      automations (Alexa ↔ MA, Voice PE duck/restore) to back off.
      Shared with Email Follow-Me for cross-blueprint coordination.
      Also adds full duck/restore cycles for other media players
      in the standard reminder loop (R5b/R9b/R9c), long-tail
      single_check (LT6b/LT8b/LT8c), and full_restart (FR-duck)
      paths — previously only the main announcement path ducked
      other players, leaving reminders competing with background
      music at full volume.
    - **v3.7.7:** Agent display name — new optional text input
      in §① lets you specify the persona name the conversation
      agent goes by (e.g., "Rick", "Quark", "Jarvis"). Injected
      into both the initial LLM prompt (step 7) and the reminder
      prompt (R6) so the agent recognizes references to itself
      in notification content without hardcoding persona names.
      Leave empty for generic "assistant" phrasing.
    - **v3.7.6:** Stale dismissal fix — R3d now compares the
      `post_time` attribute of the removed notification against
      the triggering notification's `post_time`. Previously,
      the sender+package match had no temporal awareness, so a
      dismissed notification from the same contact would
      permanently suppress all future reminders from that
      contact until a different sender's notification was
      dismissed. Now only dismissals with `post_time` >= the
      trigger's `post_time` exit the loop. Step 9c captures
      `_trigger_post_time` for the comparison.
    - **v3.7.5:** Notification dismissal exit — new optional
      `last_removed_notification` sensor input in §⑧. The
      reminder loop now checks if the user dismissed the
      notification matching the original sender AND app. Only
      an exact sender + package match exits the loop —
      dismissing unrelated notifications (Gmail, YouTube, etc.)
      is safely ignored. Fixes reminders persisting after the
      user has already read and dismissed the message.
    - **v3.7.4:** Satellite volume race-condition fix — new optional
      input_text helper in §⑤ stores the target satellite's original
      volume using first-write-wins logic. When rapid-fire
      notifications trigger parallel runs, the second run reads
      the true pre-duck volume from the helper instead of
      snapshotting the already-adjusted level. Cleared after
      restore. Same pattern as the duck_snapshot_helper in §⑦.
      Leave empty for per-run snapshots (original behavior).

            --- EXPRESSIVE TEXT INTERPRETATION ---
            The message may contain informal, expressive text that
            is NOT meant to be read literally. Interpret these
            patterns naturally for spoken delivery:
            {% if _expr_sens == 'conservative' %}
            Only interpret obvious laughter patterns (hahaha, jajaja,
            LOL) and explicit emoji-only messages. Leave other
            informal text as-is.
            {% elif _expr_sens == 'aggressive' %}
            Aggressively interpret ALL informal text as expressive
            intent — elongated words, emoji clusters, repeated
            punctuation, slang abbreviations, and any text that
            looks more emotional than informational. Convert
            everything into natural spoken language.
            {% else %}
            Interpret laughter, elongated words (nooooo, siiii),
            emoji clusters, and other clearly expressive text as
            emotional intent. Describe what the sender is expressing
            rather than spelling out the characters.
            {% endif %}

            Key rules:
            - Laughter patterns → describe as laughter, never
              spell out syllables (no "ja ja ja")
            - Emoji-only messages → describe the emotional
              sentiment, never name individual emoji
            - Elongated words → interpret the emphasis, don't
              reproduce the stretching
            - Repeated punctuation (!!!, ???) → convey the
              energy through your delivery, not by reading
              the punctuation
            {% set _expr_ref = expressive_ref | default('') | string | trim %}
            {% if _expr_ref | length > 0 %}

            Cultural reference patterns (format: pattern=meaning):
            {{ _expr_ref }}
            Use these as hints — generalize to similar patterns
            the sender might use.

            --- TTS PERFORMANCE DIRECTIVES (ElevenLabs v3) ---
            Your output will be spoken by an ElevenLabs v3 voice.
            You may insert audio tags in square brackets to direct
            the voice performance. Available tags include:
            [laughs], [whispers], [shouts], [sighs], [pauses],
            [sarcastic], [excited], [gasps], [cheerfully],
            [deadpan], [playfully], [hesitates].
            {% if _tag_style == 'minimal' %}
            Use tags sparingly — only for strong emotional moments.
            Most announcements should have zero tags. Reserve them
            for content that genuinely demands dramatization.
            {% elif _tag_style == 'dramatic' %}
            Use tags liberally for theatrical delivery. Add
            performance cues wherever they enhance the emotional
            texture — reactions, pauses, tone shifts, laughter.
            Make it a performance.
            {% else %}
            Use tags in moderation — typically 1-2 per announcement
            for natural emphasis. React to emotional content with
            appropriate tags but don't overdo it.
            {% endif %}

            Important: Tags go INLINE with your text, not on
            separate lines. Example: "[laughs] She thinks that's
            hilarious." Never put tags where they'd interrupt a
            word or break a sentence unnaturally. Never end your
            response with an audio tag — always follow tags with
            spoken text so the voice has something to transition into.

                  Lines in the message thread prefixed with "You:"
                  are messages sent BY the notification recipient
                  (the person you are speaking to) — not from the
                  sender or any third party. Do not treat the text
                  after "You:" as a person's name. These are the
                  user's own outbound replies.

                  --- PRONOUN CONTEXT ---
                  When "you" or "tú" appears in the message text,
                  it usually refers to the notification recipient —
                  not to you. The exception is when the sender
                  addresses you by name; in that case, they are
                  speaking to you directly.

                  The message may contain informal, expressive text
                  that is NOT meant to be read literally. Interpret
                  these patterns naturally for spoken delivery:
                  {% if _expr_sens == 'conservative' %}
                  Only interpret obvious laughter patterns (hahaha,
                  jajaja, LOL) and explicit emoji-only messages.
                  Leave other informal text as-is.
                  {% elif _expr_sens == 'aggressive' %}
                  Aggressively interpret ALL informal text as
                  expressive intent — elongated words, emoji
                  clusters, repeated punctuation, slang, and any
                  text that looks emotional. Convert everything
                  into natural spoken language.
                  {% else %}
                  Interpret laughter, elongated words (nooooo,
                  siiii), emoji clusters, and other clearly
                  expressive text as emotional intent. Describe
                  what the sender is expressing rather than
                  spelling out the characters.
                  {% endif %}

                  Key rules:
                  - Laughter → describe as laughter, never spell
                    out syllables
                  - Emoji-only → describe sentiment, never name
                    individual emoji
                  - Elongation → interpret emphasis, don't
                    reproduce stretching
                  - Repeated punctuation → convey energy through
                    delivery, not by reading punctuation

                  Your output will be spoken by an ElevenLabs v3
                  voice. You may insert audio tags in square
                  brackets to direct voice performance:
                  [laughs], [whispers], [shouts], [sighs],
                  [pauses], [sarcastic], [excited], [gasps],
                  [cheerfully], [deadpan], [playfully].
                  {% if _tag_style == 'minimal' %}
                  Use tags sparingly — only for strong emotional
                  moments. Most reminders need zero tags.
                  {% elif _tag_style == 'dramatic' %}
                  Use tags liberally for theatrical delivery.
                  React, pause, emote — make it a performance.
                  {% else %}
                  Use 1-2 tags per reminder for natural emphasis.
                  Don't overdo it.
                  {% endif %}
                  Tags go inline: "[laughs] She thinks that's
                  hilarious." Never break words with tags. Never
                  end with an audio tag — always follow with speech.
